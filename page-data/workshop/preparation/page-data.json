Download the version of your OS and follow the installation steps described in this [page](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/).\n</AccordionItem>\n\n\n</Accordion>\n\n***\n\n## Accessing the Hub Cluster\n\n1.Open your Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management Web Console (if you are not there, check [here](../beforestart/) how to open your console page).\n\n  ![](images/1-cloudpak-cli.png)\n\n2.Select the **user icon**, then click **Configure client**.\n\n  ![](images/2-cloudpak-cli.png)\n\n3.The cluster configuration details display and resemble the client configuration code. Copy and paste the configuration information to your command line, and press Enter.\n\n  ![](images/11-cloudpak-cli.png)\n\n  ![](images/12-cloudpak-cli.png)\n\n4.Check the Kubernetes contexts available, running the command below:\n\n```\nkubectl config get-contexts\n```\n\n  You should have a mycluster-context that point to your ROKS Hub cluster.\n\n  ![](images/13-cloudpak-cli.png)\n\n  Next step, you will rename this context to simplify how you interact with your ROKS Hub server during our lab.\n\n5.Rename your context, running the command below:\n\n```\nkubectl config rename-context mycluster-context hub-cluster\n```\n\n6.Now, let's set the current Kubernetes context\n\n```\nkubectl config use-context hub-cluster\n```\n\n  >Note: Anytime that you want to connect to your Hub cluster, you just need to run the command above.\n\n7.Let's test the new context configuration. Run the command below to get the cluster nodes.\n\n```\noc get nodes\n```\n\n  ![](images/24-cloudpak-cli.png)\n\n  Great, your Hub cluster is configured and ready to use.\n\n***\n\n## Cloning the Preparation Scripts\n\n1.In this Workshop in a Box, you will use a Multi User architecture. One CP4MCM ROKS will be used to support multiple lab users. To simplify the process of integrate LDAP, create multiple users and other details, the DTE team created some preparation scripts. Let's clone these scripts. Open your terminal window and execute the command below.\n```\ngit clone https://github.ibm.com/demohub/cp4mcm-wiab.git\n```\n\n2.Open the cp4mcm-wiab folder.\n```\ncd cp4mcm-wiab\n```\n\n3.Here you see 4 files. Change the file permission to be able to execute them.\n```\nchmod 755 *\n```\n\n4.Now, edit the 00-variables file.\n```\nvi 00-variables\n```\n\n5.Change the **CPK4MCM_FQDN** to point to your Cloud Pak for MCM console page.\n\n  ![](images/1-change-variables.png)\n\n6.Change the **NUMBER_LAB_USERS** with the number of users that you will have in your Workshop. We recommend a number between 1 and 30. The script will use this number to create the users on LDAP, Teams on CP4MCM, etc. **Save** your file.\n\n  ![](images/2-change-variables.png)\n\n  Great, now you are ready to run the Preparation scripts.\n\n***\n\n## Executing the Scripts\n\n1.Let's execute the first script. This script will deploy an OpenLDAP instance for your Cloud Pak for Multicloud Manamement, with your *labusers*. In the middle of the script, you will be prompt to enter your CP4MCM admin and password.\n```\n./01-WiaB-mcm-ldap.sh\n```\n\n  ![](images/1-executing-script.png)\n\n  Your labusers are **labuser1, labuser2, labuser3 ... labuserX** (where X is the number that you specified in the NUMBER_LAB_USERS variable) and their password are **passw0rd**.\n\n2.Now that you have your LDAP with users. Let's use a script to register your *hub-cluster* in Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management. The hub-cluster will be added as a managed cluster, and all the lab users will use it as a second cluster. In the script, you will include some labels in the hub-cluster.\n```\n./02-WiaB-mcm-hub-registration.sh\n```\n\n  NOTE: If you receive the following error: unable to recognize \"STDIN\": no matches for kind \"Endpoint\" in version \"multicloud.ibm.com/v1beta1\". Execute the import command bellow again:\n\n```\nkubectl apply -f cluster-import-final.yaml\n```\n\n\n3.Let's execute the final script. This script will create the namespaces, teams and include the resources in Teams.\n```\n./03-WiaB-mcm-create-lab-teams.sh\n```\n\n  Great now your environment should be ready for your Workshop. Next section, you will just validate the environment.\n\n***\n\n## Validating the Environment\n\n1.Back to the Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management Web Console.
