This cluster will be a Managed cluster in the IBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management Workshop. In IBM Cloud, you can have 1 free cluster at a time in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, and each free cluster expires in 30 days. Free clusters have [select capabilities](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_ov#cluster_types), minimal 2x4 compute resources, select single zone locations, and support only the Kubernetes container platform and IBM Cloud classic infrastructure provider. Free clusters are ideal for testing out Kubernetes deployments and getting familiar with the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service API, CLI, and console tools.\n\n**Note:** to create a free cluster, you need to have an [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration) and upgrade your account to a [Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-upgrading-account), where you are the owner or have (full Administrator access)[https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-assign-access-resources].\n\n\n1. Now that you have your IBM Cloud account ready to create a free IKS Cluster. In the [IBM Cloud Catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog?category=containers#services), select **Kubernetes Service**.\n\n  ![](images/1-free-iks.png)\n\n2. Select the **Free** cluster option (1). You can keep the default name: mycluster-free (2).\n\n  ![](images/2-free-iks.png)\n\n3. Click **Create Cluster**. A worker pool is created that contains one worker node.\n\n  ![](images/3-free-iks.png)\n\n  The worker node can take a few minutes to provision, but you can see the progress in the **Worker nodes** tab. When the status reaches Ready, you can start working with your cluster.\n\n***\n\n## Installing CLI Tools\n\nCLI tools provide the ability to manage applications, containers, infrastructures, services, and other resources. In this section you will install all the necessary CLI tool in your local machine to be able to complete the Labs.\n\n*Note:* If you have already installed all CLIs in your local machine, you can skip this page.\n\n\n<Accordion>\n  <AccordionItem title=\"Install IBM Cloud Pak CLI (cloudctl)\">\n\n1.You should be on your CP4MCM Web Console, if not, check how to access it in [Before Start](../beforestart/) page.\n\n  From the CP4MCM Web Console page, select the **user icon**, then click **Configure client**.\n\n  ![](images/2-cloudpak-cli.png)\n\n2.Click **Install CLI tools**.\n\n  ![](images/3-cloudpak-cli.png)\n\n3.Expand **Install IBM Cloud Pak CLI (cloudctl)**.

Remember that the curl command for your cluster is located in the console:\n\n```\nchmod 755 <path_to_installer>/<install_file>\nsudo mv <path_to_installer>/<install_file> /usr/local/bin/cloudctl\n```\n\n  For Windows, rename the downloaded file to cloudctl and place the file on the PATH environment variable.\n\n  ![](images/6-cloudpak-cli.png)\n\n5.Confirm that cloudctl is installed:\n\n```\ncloudctl --help\n```\n\n  ![](images/7-cloudpak-cli.png)\n\n6.Log in to your cluster with the following command:\n```\ncloudctl login -a <CP4MCM_Console_URL>  --skip-ssl-validation\n```\n\n  Where `CP4MCM_Console_URL` is the hostname of your CP4MCM console, something like *https://icp-console.playgroth-mcm...appdomain.cloud*\n\n  After the command, you need to enter your CP4MCM **admin user** (1), your admin **password** (32 charecters password that you defined in the CP4MCM installation) and enter **default** as namespace.\n\n  ![](images/7_2-cluster-mgmt-img.png)\n\n</AccordionItem>\n\n  <AccordionItem title=\"Install Kubectl CLI\">\n\n1.Let's set up the kubectl CLI.
